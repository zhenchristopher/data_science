    "Emily: I'd like to gain a better understanding of what this seemingly vague term \"data science\" means...I suppose it encompasses a wide variety of skills that can be used in many fields, which is maybe why I have been unable to grasp exactly what is. I hope that the techniques I learn in this class will help me in my future research in graduate school and also in industry work. There's nothing in particular I know I want to learn, but I do want to finally understand what those terms \"Bayesian statistics\" and \"Markov chains\" mean that I've heard being tossed around in my years at this school. Also, what does \"statistically significant\" REALLY mean? Since I haven't had a formal statistics class before, I want exposure to as many aspects of the field as possible. Taking ChE130 (biomolecular engineering lab) was frustrating without prior knowledge of statistics, as there was no formal training in that class on how to actually analyze the data from our independent projects, so I'm taking this class to remedy that. I definitely wish I had taken this class before 130!"
